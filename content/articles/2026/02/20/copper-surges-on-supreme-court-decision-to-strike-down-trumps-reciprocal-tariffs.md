title: Copper Surges on Supreme Court Decision to Strike Down Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs
---

Copper prices rose in London trading on Friday following a significant legal development affecting U.S. trade policy. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff framework, a decision that prompted gains across American stock markets and provided relief to commodity traders concerned about trade headwinds.

The reciprocal tariffs had cast a shadow over global trade prospects and weighed on commodity outlooks in recent weeks. The Supreme Court's invalidation of the tariff regime removes this uncertainty, at least temporarily, allowing markets to reassess economic conditions without the threat of sweeping trade barriers.

Copper, widely considered a barometer of global economic health due to its use in construction, manufacturing, and electrical applications, responded positively to the news. The commodity's gains tracked broader strength in U.S. equity markets, which rallied on the tariff decision.

The ruling represents a significant setback to the administration's trade policy agenda and signals judicial constraints on executive tariff authority. Market participants have noted that the decision reduces near-term risks to international commerce and manufacturing supply chains that had faced potential disruption under the tariff regime.
