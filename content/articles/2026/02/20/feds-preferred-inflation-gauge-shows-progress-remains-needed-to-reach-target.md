title: Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Shows Progress Remains Needed to Reach Target
---

The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, showed price increases approaching 3% in 2025, signaling that persistent inflationary pressures remain above the Fed's long-term target despite recent policy efforts.

The data reflects that while inflation has moderated from its 2022 peak, the trajectory toward the Fed's 2% target has slowed. The central bank has relied on this metric as its primary tool for assessing price stability and guiding monetary policy decisions, as it provides a broader measure of inflation across consumer spending patterns compared to other indices.

The results underscore the challenges facing policymakers as they attempt to balance efforts to reduce inflation without unnecessarily constraining economic growth. The persistence of elevated inflation suggests that factors contributing to price pressures—including supply chain dynamics, labor market conditions, and consumer demand—continue to influence the economic environment.

Fed officials will likely view this data as evidence that additional policy adjustments or sustained current conditions may be necessary to achieve their inflation objectives. The reading comes as the central bank navigates decisions about interest rates and their broader impact on economic activity.

## Key Takeaways

- PCE inflation rose to approximately 3% in 2025, remaining above the Fed's 2% target
- The Fed's preferred inflation measure indicates persistent price pressures despite recent policy efforts
- Current levels suggest additional work is needed to return to pre-pandemic inflation rates
- The data will likely influence upcoming monetary policy decisions and forward guidance
