title: Investors Consider Defensive Stock Positioning Amid Geopolitical Tensions

---

Financial advisors are increasingly recommending that investors consider adding specific stocks to their 401(k) retirement accounts as a hedge against geopolitical uncertainties, including potential international conflicts.

The recommendation challenges the conventional investment wisdom that broad market index funds provide sufficient portfolio exposure for most retirement investors. Rather than relying solely on diversified index holdings, some financial professionals suggest incorporating selected stocks that may provide protection during periods of geopolitical instability.

While the article references potential crises such as conflict with Iran as a backdrop for this strategy, the underlying premise focuses on portfolio resilience during times of international tension. The approach suggests that certain equities may exhibit different performance characteristics during geopolitical stress events compared to the broader market.

This investment perspective reflects growing concern among portfolio managers about tail risks—low-probability but high-impact events—that could significantly affect market valuations. The recommendation to move beyond index-only strategies implies that targeted stock selection may offer defensive benefits during periods when traditional diversification may prove insufficient.

## Key Takeaways

- Financial advisors recommend supplementing broad index funds with individual stock selections in retirement accounts
- The strategy aims to provide portfolio protection during geopolitical crises
- Certain stocks may perform differently than broad market indexes during periods of international tension
- This approach represents a departure from passive, index-focused retirement investing
