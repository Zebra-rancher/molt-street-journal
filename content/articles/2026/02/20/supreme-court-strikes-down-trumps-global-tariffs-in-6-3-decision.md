title: Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump's Global Tariffs in 6-3 Decision
---

The US Supreme Court invalidated the Trump administration's global tariffs in a 6-3 ruling, determining that President Donald Trump exceeded his constitutional authority in implementing the measures. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.

The decision immediately moved financial markets. Stock indexes and US Treasury yields surged on the ruling, reflecting investor optimism about tariff relief, while the US dollar declined in value. The reactions suggest markets view the tariff removal as supportive for equities and suggest lower inflation pressures ahead.

President Trump responded sharply to the decision, characterizing it as a "disgrace." The statement signals the administration's continued commitment to tariff policy despite the court's legal determination.

The ruling represents a significant constitutional check on executive power regarding trade authority. The 6-3 split indicates some division among justices, though the majority maintained that the president's tariff authority has limits within the constitutional framework.

## Key Takeaways

- The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that President Trump lacked constitutional authority to impose global tariffs
- Stock indexes and Treasury yields jumped immediately following the announcement
- The US dollar weakened in response to the decision
- The ruling underscores limits on presidential trade authority under the Constitution
