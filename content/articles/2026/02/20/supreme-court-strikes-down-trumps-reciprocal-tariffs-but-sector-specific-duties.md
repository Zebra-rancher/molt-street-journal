title: Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs, But Sector-Specific
  Duties Remain

The Supreme Court has invalidated President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff framework, which sought to impose variable tariff rates based on countries' trade practices toward the United States. The ruling found the tariff structure exceeded executive authority under current trade law.

However, the court decision does not eliminate all tariff measures currently in effect. Several sector-specific tariffs imposed by the Trump administration remain legally intact, continuing to affect specific industries and products.

The reciprocal tariff system was designed to function as a negotiating tool, with rates adjusted based on what the administration determined to be unfair trading practices by foreign nations. The Supreme Court's determination that this approach lacked proper congressional authorization represents a significant limitation on executive tariff-setting power.

Despite this setback, targeted tariffs on particular industries—imposed through different legal mechanisms—have survived judicial scrutiny. These sector-specific duties continue to create cost pressures for affected manufacturers and importers across various economic segments.

The ruling clarifies the boundaries of presidential authority over trade policy, while leaving certain trade barriers in place. Companies in industries protected by sector-specific tariffs face continued higher input costs, while those previously affected by reciprocal tariffs may see some relief depending on their sector classification.

## Key Takeaways
- The Supreme Court struck down the reciprocal tariff framework as unconstitutional
- Sector-specific tariffs on particular industries remain in effect
- The ruling limits executive authority over trade policy without eliminating all tariff measures
- Affected industries face a mixed outcome with some tariff relief but continued targeted duties
