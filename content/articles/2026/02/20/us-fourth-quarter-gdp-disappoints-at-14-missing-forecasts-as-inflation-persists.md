title: U.S. Fourth-Quarter GDP Disappoints at 1.4%, Missing Forecasts as Inflation
  Persists
---

The U.S. economy expanded at a significantly slower pace than anticipated in the fourth quarter, growing at an annualized rate of 1.4%—a substantial miss against the 2.5% forecast. The weaker-than-expected growth reflects broader economic headwinds that have constrained recent expansion.

Meanwhile, inflation remained sticky, with the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index—the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure—rising 3% year-over-year in December. This matched expectations but indicates that price pressures have persisted despite efforts to cool demand.

The combination of sluggish growth and persistent inflation presents a challenging backdrop for policymakers. Slower economic expansion typically creates conditions for central banks to consider easing monetary policy, yet elevated inflation may constrain their ability to cut rates aggressively.

The fourth-quarter GDP report underperforms recent economic momentum and could influence expectations for growth in 2026. Consumer spending patterns, business investment, and trade dynamics will remain critical factors shaping the outlook.

## Key Takeaways

- Q4 GDP growth of 1.4% missed the 2.5% consensus forecast by a significant margin
- Core PCE inflation held steady at 3%, meeting expectations but signaling persistent price pressures
- The weak growth-inflation combination creates a complex policy environment for the Federal Reserve
- Economic momentum appears to be decelerating from earlier trends

Investors and policymakers will closely monitor upcoming employment data and consumer spending indicators to assess whether growth stabilizes or continues to falter.
