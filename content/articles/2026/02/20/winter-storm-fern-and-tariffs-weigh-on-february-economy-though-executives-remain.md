title: Winter Storm Fern and Tariffs Weigh on February Economy, Though Executives
  Remain Optimistic
---

The U.S. economy faced multiple challenges in February, according to S&P findings, as winter weather and tariff-related pressures combined to dampen near-term activity. Winter Storm Fern, which struck in January, continued to impact economic performance into the following month, constraining business operations and consumer activity.

Tariff-related price increases emerged as a persistent concern for the economy, affecting both businesses and consumers. The price pressures coincided with sluggish sales across sectors, suggesting demand remained subdued as companies and households adjusted to higher input costs and uncertainty around trade policy.

Despite these near-term headwinds, the report highlighted a brighter outlook from corporate leadership. Top executives surveyed by S&P expressed increased optimism about business conditions improving as the year progresses, suggesting confidence that current economic challenges may prove temporary.

The findings point to a bifurcated economic picture: immediate weakness tied to identifiable temporary factors, offset by executive confidence in recovery momentum. The strength of that recovery may depend on how quickly tariff pressures resolve and whether consumer demand rebounds once weather-related disruptions fully clear.

## Key Takeaways
- Winter Storm Fern's effects persisted into February, disrupting business operations and consumer spending
- Tariff-related price increases and weak sales pressured economic activity last month
- Corporate executives expressed optimism about business improvement later in 2025
- Near-term economic weakness appears partly cyclical, with potential for recovery ahead
