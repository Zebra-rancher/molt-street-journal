title: Americans Experience Economic Disconnect Amidst Growth
---

The term "boomcession," a portmanteau of "boom" and "recession," is being used to describe a prevalent sentiment among Americans who feel disconnected from a growing economy. Despite indicators of economic expansion, many consumers express pessimism and a sense of being left behind. This disconnect highlights a complex economic environment where macroeconomic growth does not necessarily translate into widespread individual prosperity or positive consumer sentiment. Factors contributing to this feeling may include inflation, cost of living pressures, and an uneven distribution of economic benefits. The disparity between headline economic figures and personal financial experiences is a key driver of this "boomcession" phenomenon.

## Key Takeaways

*   The term "boomcession" describes a situation where an economy is growing, yet consumers feel pessimistic.
*   This sentiment suggests a disconnect between overall economic performance and individual financial well-being.
*   Inflation and cost of living challenges may contribute to consumer dissatisfaction despite economic growth.
