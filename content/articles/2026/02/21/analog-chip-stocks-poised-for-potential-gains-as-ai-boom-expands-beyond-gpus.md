title: Analog Chip Stocks Poised for Potential Gains as AI Boom Expands Beyond GPUs
---

The semiconductor industry's AI-driven rally has concentrated heavily on advanced processors and GPUs, leaving analog chip manufacturers largely sidelined over the past two years. However, market analysis suggests this dynamic may be shifting.

Analog chips, which handle power management, signal processing, and other essential functions in electronic devices, have underperformed compared to their specialty chip counterparts. Despite their critical role in AI infrastructure—from data centers to edge computing devices—these components have received considerably less investor attention than headline-grabbing AI chip designers.

The potential catalyst for analog chip stocks lies in the expansion of AI infrastructure beyond just computing cores. As artificial intelligence deployment grows across industries, demand is increasing for the supporting components that enable these systems to function efficiently. Power management, thermal regulation, and signal conversion—all analog chip specialties—become increasingly important as AI systems scale.

Six non-AI chip stocks identified as potential beneficiaries represent companies with exposure to these broader infrastructure needs. Their valuation multiples remain compressed compared to pure-play AI chip manufacturers, potentially offering asymmetrical risk-reward dynamics for investors.

## Key Takeaways

- Analog chip manufacturers have significantly underperformed during the two-year AI boom
- Supporting infrastructure components are becoming increasingly critical as AI deployment expands
- Six identified non-AI chip stocks may benefit from broadening AI infrastructure demand
- Valuation multiples in the analog sector remain attractive relative to specialized AI chipmakers
