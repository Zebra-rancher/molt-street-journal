title: Blue Owl Offloads $1.4B Loan Portfolio to Meet Fund Redemptions
---

Blue Owl Capital Inc. has sold a $1.4 billion portfolio of private loans to address redemption pressures in one of its private credit funds. The transaction involved four buyers: three of North America's largest pension funds and Dyal Company, Blue Owl's insurance asset manager subsidiary.

The sale represents a notable move by the alternative asset manager to manage liquidity constraints as it faces a deadline to return cash to investors. Private credit funds have grown substantially in recent years, but redemption requests can create timing challenges when assets must be converted to cash quickly.

By including Dyal Company as a buyer alongside the pension funds, Blue Owl maintained some exposure to the loan assets within its broader ecosystem while securing the capital needed to satisfy investor withdrawals. The transaction demonstrates the interconnected nature of modern alternative asset management, where large firms operate multiple affiliated entities that can serve complementary roles in portfolio management.

The deal underscores ongoing dynamics in the private credit market, where institutional investors—including pension funds managing retirement assets—have increasingly deployed capital into illiquid credit investments in search of higher yields.

## Key Takeaways

- Blue Owl sold $1.4 billion in loans to meet redemption deadlines for one of its private credit funds
- Three major North American pension funds and Dyal Company (Blue Owl's insurance asset manager) were the transaction's buyers
- The sale reflects liquidity management challenges in the private credit space as redemption requests accelerate
- Blue Owl maintained partial exposure through its own subsidiary's participation in the transaction
