title: ECB's Panetta Says US Has Borne Brunt of Trump Tariff Impact
---

European Central Bank Governing Council member Fabio Panetta stated that the United States economy has shouldered the largest burden from tariffs implemented under President Donald Trump's administration.

Panetta's comments reflect growing international scrutiny of the tariff policies and their economic consequences. The ECB official's assessment suggests that the protective trade measures have not achieved their intended effect of insulating the American economy from external competition. Instead, the policies appear to have generated substantial domestic costs.

The statement aligns with broader economic analysis indicating that tariffs typically raise consumer prices and can dampen business investment and growth. By targeting imports across multiple sectors, the tariffs have affected supply chains, manufacturing costs, and consumer purchasing power within the United States.

Panetta's remarks underscore a key debate in international economic policy: whether protectionist measures achieve their stated objectives or instead create unintended economic damage for the implementing nation. The ECB official's public assessment suggests that European policymakers view the tariff strategy as counterproductive to US economic interests.
