title: Financial Advisor Evaluates Early Retirement Feasibility at Age 60 With $2M
  in Assets

A financial advisor has evaluated the retirement readiness of a 60-year-old with combined assets of approximately $1.98 million, including $1.1 million in cash, $880,000 in a 401(k), along with future pension and Social Security benefits.

The analysis examined whether these resources provide sufficient income to sustain retirement at an earlier-than-typical age. Key considerations in such evaluations typically include withdrawal rates, healthcare costs before Medicare eligibility at 65, longevity risk, and the impact of claiming Social Security at various ages.

The advisor's assessment factors in multiple income streams that would become available to the prospective retiree, including pension payments and eventual Social Security benefits. Early claiming of Social Security before the full retirement age would reduce monthly benefits, a trade-off that must be weighed against the ability to access funds sooner.

Healthcare represents a significant variable for those retiring before 65, as Medicare eligibility begins at that age. The substantial cash position of $1.1 million provides flexibility for managing pre-Medicare years, though insurance costs must be factored into retirement projections.

## Key Takeaways

- Total liquid and retirement assets exceed $1.98 million, combining cash, 401(k), pension, and future Social Security
- Healthcare costs before age 65 present a critical planning consideration for early retirees
- Multiple income sources provide potential flexibility in claiming strategies and withdrawal timing
- Early Social Security claiming reduces lifetime benefits but increases near-term cash flow availability
