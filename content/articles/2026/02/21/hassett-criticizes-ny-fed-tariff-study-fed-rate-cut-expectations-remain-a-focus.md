title: Hassett Criticizes NY Fed Tariff Study, Fed Rate Cut Expectations Remain a
  Focus
---

Kevin Hassett, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has publicly condemned a recent study by the New York Federal Reserve concerning the economic impact of tariffs. Hassett, speaking to CNBC, described the paper as the "worst paper I've ever seen" and suggested that its authors should face disciplinary action. According to Hassett's critique, the researchers at the central bank's New York branch allegedly overlooked critical aspects of how tariffs function in practice.

The New York Fed study, which has drawn such strong criticism, reportedly examined the effects of import duties on the economy. While the specifics of the study's findings were not detailed in the provided summary, Hassett's reaction indicates a significant disagreement with its methodology or conclusions, particularly regarding the real-world mechanisms through which tariffs operate.

This criticism of economic research from a prominent former economic advisor comes at a time when broader economic indicators and potential Federal Reserve actions are also under close scrutiny. Market observers and financial institutions are actively trying to gauge the trajectory of U.S. monetary policy, with a particular focus on the number of potential interest rate cuts the Federal Reserve might implement throughout the current year.

The outlook for interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve is a key driver of market sentiment and investment strategies. Economists and analysts are closely monitoring inflation data, employment figures, and overall economic growth to predict the Federal Reserve's next moves. Different institutions and experts offer varying projections for the timing and magnitude of these potential rate cuts.

While Hassett's strong disapproval targets a specific research paper, it highlights the ongoing debate and scrutiny surrounding economic analysis and policy recommendations. The effectiveness and impact of economic tools like tariffs, as well as the strategic decisions of central banks regarding interest rates, remain central themes in economic discourse.

As the economic landscape continues to evolve, the interplay between fiscal policies, such as tariffs, and monetary policy, guided by central banks like the Federal Reserve, will likely remain a subject of intense analysis and discussion. The accuracy and robustness of the economic research underpinning these policy discussions are of paramount importance.
