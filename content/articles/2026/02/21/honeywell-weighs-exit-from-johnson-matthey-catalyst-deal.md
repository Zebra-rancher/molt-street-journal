title: Honeywell Weighs Exit From Johnson Matthey Catalyst Deal
---

Honeywell International Inc. is evaluating the possibility of withdrawing from its acquisition of Johnson Matthey Plc's Catalyst Technologies business, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

The move represents a significant shift in the companies' transaction, which would bring the catalyst manufacturing division under Honeywell's portfolio. Catalysts are used across multiple industrial applications, including refining, chemicals, and environmental control systems—areas central to both companies' operations.

The nature of Honeywell's reconsideration remains unclear from available information. Potential factors could include regulatory hurdles, financing considerations, or changes in strategic priorities. Honeywell has not yet made a final determination regarding the deal's future.

Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies division specializes in producing catalysts for petrochemical processing, emission control, and fine chemical manufacturing. The unit represents a strategic asset within Johnson Matthey's portfolio of specialty materials and chemicals.

This development marks a notable development in industrial dealmaking, as major acquisitions face increasing scrutiny in current market conditions. The outcome will affect both companies' strategic positioning within the catalyst and industrial chemicals sectors.
