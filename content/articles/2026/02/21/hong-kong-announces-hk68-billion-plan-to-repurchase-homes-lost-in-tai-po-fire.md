Hong Kong authorities have unveiled a HK$6.8 billion ($870 million) acquisition program to repurchase residential flats from residents displaced by the Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po last year. The buyback initiative offers prices that exceed earlier estimates, according to government officials.

The program represents a significant financial commitment to assist residents who lost their homes in the blaze. By offering above-estimated acquisition prices, the government aims to provide fair compensation and facilitate the rebuilding process for affected families. The higher valuations reflect the government's recognition of the substantial losses residents endured.

Wang Fuk Court, a public housing complex in Tai Po, experienced a major fire that resulted in significant property damage and displacement. The buyback scheme is part of the government's comprehensive response to the disaster, enabling former residents to recover financially from their losses.

The initiative demonstrates Hong Kong's approach to disaster relief through direct financial intervention in the property market. By purchasing the damaged units at favorable rates, the government removes the burden of selling fire-damaged properties from residents while maintaining market stability in the affected area.
