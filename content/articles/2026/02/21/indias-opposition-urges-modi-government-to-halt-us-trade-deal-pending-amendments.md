title: India's Opposition Urges Modi Government to Halt US Trade Deal Pending Amendments
---

---

India's opposition has formally called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration to place the proposed trade deal with the United States on hold and seek amendments before moving forward with negotiations.

The opposition's request reflects concerns about the current terms of the bilateral trade agreement being negotiated between New Delhi and Washington. While specific objections were not detailed in the statement, such calls typically center on protections for domestic industries, agricultural sectors, or intellectual property provisions that may disadvantage Indian businesses or workers.

The timing of the opposition's appeal comes as trade negotiations between India and the US have progressed through multiple rounds of discussions. India's trade relationships have increasingly come under scrutiny as the nation seeks to balance economic growth with protection of domestic sectors.

The Modi government has not immediately responded to the opposition's request. India's approach to trade negotiations typically involves extensive consultations with various stakeholder groups, including industry representatives, labor unions, and political parties.

## Key Takeaways

- Opposition parties are seeking a pause on US-India trade negotiations pending amendments
- The request suggests concerns about current deal terms and their impact on Indian interests
- Trade negotiations between India and the US remain ongoing with no timeline specified
- The Modi government's response to these calls is pending
