JPMorgan Chase has confirmed that it closed the accounts of former President Donald Trump following the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The bank's actions came after a period of review and were reportedly a consequence of the events of that day.

The decision to close Trump's accounts was not disclosed at the time, but it has become public through legal proceedings. JPMorgan's general counsel, Mary Ervinen, stated in a court filing that the bank had "incurred expenses in connection with its review of its customers' relationships with the Trump Organization."

This action by JPMorgan adds to the scrutiny financial institutions faced regarding their business dealings with entities associated with former President Trump. The bank's decision reflects a stance taken by some corporations to distance themselves from individuals or organizations perceived to be associated with the events of January 6th.
