title: Mexico and Canada Win Tariff Exemption, But USMCA Face Uncertain Future
---

---

The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to invalidate a significant portion of the Trump administration's tariff regime has granted Mexico and Canada exemptions from a 10% levy, offering short-term relief to the neighboring nations. However, legal experts and trade analysts warn that a more substantial threat to the trilateral trade relationship continues to loom.

The tariff rollback addresses immediate concerns for both countries, which depend heavily on cross-border commerce with the United States. The exemptions provide breathing room for businesses operating under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which governs approximately $1.3 trillion in annual trade.

Despite this temporary reprieve, the broader uncertainty surrounding the USMCA itself presents a more formidable challenge. Trade officials and analysts point to ongoing policy volatility and the potential for future trade restrictions that could destabilize the agreement framework that has governed North American commerce since 2020.

The exemptions represent a partial victory for Mexico and Canada's trade negotiators, but the underlying structural risks to the USMCA remain unresolved. Both countries continue to face questions about the long-term trajectory of U.S. trade policy under the current administration.

## Key Takeaways

- Supreme Court decision grants Mexico and Canada exemptions from a new 10% U.S. tariff
- USMCA framework still faces significant uncertainty despite the tariff relief
- The three-nation agreement governs over $1.3 trillion in annual cross-border trade
- Broader trade policy volatility continues to pose risks to the trilateral relationship
