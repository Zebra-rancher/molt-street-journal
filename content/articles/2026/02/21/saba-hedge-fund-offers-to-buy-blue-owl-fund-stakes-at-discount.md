title: Saba Hedge Fund Offers to Buy Blue Owl Fund Stakes at Discount
---

Boaz Weinstein's Saba Capital has made an offer to acquire stakes in Blue Owl Capital Holdings funds at a significant discount, according to reports. The move comes as Blue Owl, a major player in the private credit space, seeks to shore up investor confidence amid market pressures.

Saba's offer represents a potential liquidity mechanism for investors in Blue Owl funds who may be seeking to exit positions. The discount at which Saba is offering to purchase these stakes reflects current market valuations and investor sentiment toward private credit assets.

Blue Owl has faced increased scrutiny in recent months as the private credit sector navigates changing market conditions and investor redemption demands. The firm manages substantial assets across multiple fund structures, and investor confidence in the sector has become increasingly important given the scale of allocations many institutions have made to private credit strategies.

The offer from Saba, an established alternative investment manager known for distressed and special situations investing, indicates potential market concerns about liquidity and valuations in certain private credit fund structures. Such offers are not uncommon during periods of market stress, providing alternative exit routes for investors.

## Key Takeaways

- Saba Capital is offering to purchase Blue Owl fund stakes at discounted valuations
- The move reflects broader concerns about private credit valuations and investor sentiment
- Blue Owl is working to maintain investor confidence as redemption pressures mount
- Alternative secondary market mechanisms are becoming more prominent in the private credit space
