title: South Korea Confirms Trade Deal Remains on Track Despite US Tariff Ruling
---

---

South Korea's government confirmed that a recent US Supreme Court ruling striking down tariffs imposed under presidential emergency powers will not jeopardize its trade agreement with the United States.

The ruling, which invalidated tariffs that had been enacted through emergency authorities, prompted South Korean officials to reassess the status of bilateral trade relations. However, Seoul stated that the broader trade framework between the two countries remains intact and unaffected by the court's decision.

The statement comes as the Trump administration faces constraints on its ability to impose tariffs through emergency declarations. The Supreme Court's decision limits executive authority to unilaterally impose duties without congressional approval, marking a significant legal boundary on trade policy implementation.

South Korea, a major trading partner of the United States, has maintained close economic ties with Washington through existing trade agreements. Officials emphasized that the foundational trade relationship between the two nations continues to operate normally despite the tariff ruling.

The clarification from Seoul suggests confidence in the stability of US-Korea trade relations and indicates that the country does not anticipate broader disruptions to commerce resulting from the court's decision.

## Key Takeaways

- South Korea confirmed its trade agreement with the US remains valid following the Supreme Court tariff ruling
- The court decision invalidated tariffs imposed through presidential emergency powers
