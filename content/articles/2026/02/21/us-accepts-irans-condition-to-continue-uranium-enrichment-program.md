---

According to Iran's semi-official Students' News Agency (ISNA), US officials have accepted Iran's position to continue uranium enrichment operations. The acceptance of this demand was characterized as a "red line" by Iranian diplomats, indicating a condition deemed non-negotiable in ongoing discussions between the two nations.

The reported development marks a significant shift in diplomatic positioning regarding Iran's nuclear program. The uranium enrichment issue has long been central to negotiations between Iran and Western powers, with the activity restricted under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the US withdrew in 2018.

The statement, attributed to an Iranian diplomat by ISNA, suggests that discussions have progressed to acknowledge Iran's determination to maintain enrichment capabilities. Details regarding the scope, scale, or specific enrichment levels were not provided in the available information.
