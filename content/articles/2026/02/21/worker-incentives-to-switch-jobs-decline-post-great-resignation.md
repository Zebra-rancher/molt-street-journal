title: Worker Incentives to Switch Jobs Decline Post-'Great Resignation'
---

The financial incentives that previously drove workers to switch jobs during the "Great Resignation" have largely evaporated, according to recent analysis. The gap between the average annual pay increases for employees who stayed at their current positions and those who moved to new companies has narrowed considerably, returning to levels not seen since before the pandemic.

This trend suggests that the strong leverage workers once held in the labor market, characterized by significant pay bumps for job-hopping, is waning. As companies face a less competitive hiring environment, the outsized salary increases previously offered to attract new talent are becoming less common. This shift indicates a potential normalization of labor market dynamics, with the allure of higher pay for changing roles diminishing.

## Key Takeaways

*   The pay increase disparity between job switchers and job stayers has collapsed.
*   Incentives for workers to change jobs are diminishing.
*   Labor market dynamics are potentially returning to pre-pandemic norms.
