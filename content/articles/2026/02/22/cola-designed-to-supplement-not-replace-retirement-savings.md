title: COLA Designed to Supplement, Not Replace, Retirement Savings
---

The Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for Social Security and certain pensions was established to provide a measure of protection against inflation, not to be the sole source of retirement income. Its primary function is to ensure that the purchasing power of these benefits keeps pace with rising prices, preventing a decline in living standards for beneficiaries.

COLAs are calculated based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index tracks the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of goods and services. When inflation, as measured by the CPI-W, rises, the COLA increases to match that rise, thereby adjusting benefits upward.

However, the amount of the COLA is directly tied to inflation rates, meaning it can vary significantly from year to year. In years with low or no inflation, the COLA may be minimal or even zero. This variability underscores the fact that COLAs are designed as a supplementary benefit to preserve the value of core retirement income, rather than a guaranteed growth mechanism for savings. Financial experts emphasize that individuals should not rely on COLAs alone to cover all retirement expenses. A robust retirement plan typically involves a combination of Social Security benefits, personal savings, investments, and potentially pension income, with COLAs serving to maintain the real value of these components.

## Key Takeaways

*   COLAs are intended to supplement retirement income, not replace savings.
*   Their purpose is to protect against inflation and maintain purchasing power.
*   COLA amounts are based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).
*   COLAs can vary annually depending on inflation rates.

The next Social Security COLA will be announced in October, based on inflation data from the third quarter of 2024.
