title: Copper Prices Cool Amid Stockpiling Despite Long-Term Demand Outlook
---

Copper prices have retreated from a record high of over $13,000 per ton last month, settling around $12,700 this week. This decline comes as substantial stockpiling in key exchange hubs in the United States and China has emerged, contrasting with strong long-term demand expectations.

Despite a persistent outlook for robust copper demand in the future, fueled by the global push towards electrification and rising power consumption, the near-term copper market appears more vulnerable compared to the recent rally in gold prices. While long-term gold prices are anticipated to increase, the immediate environment for copper is characterized by this juxtaposition of future potential and current inventory build-ups.
