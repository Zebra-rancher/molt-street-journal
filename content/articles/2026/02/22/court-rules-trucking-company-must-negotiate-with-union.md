title: Court Rules Trucking Company Must Negotiate With Union
---

A federal appeals court has ordered a small trucking company to negotiate with a union that previously lost a representation vote. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the company, P&B Transport, engaged in unfair labor practices that undermined the election.

The court found that P&B Transport unlawfully interrogated employees about their union sympathies and threatened to close the business if the Teamsters were elected. These actions were deemed sufficient to invalidate the election results, even though the union did not secure a majority of the votes. The court’s decision emphasizes the National Labor Relations Board's authority to remedy such unfair labor practices by ordering a company to bargain with a union, provided the company's conduct has created a "general obstacle to the fair exercise of employee choice."

The ruling sets a precedent for how unfair labor practices can impact union election outcomes and the subsequent obligations of employers.

## Key Takeaways:
*   A federal appeals court has mandated that P&B Transport negotiate with the Teamsters union.
*   The court cited unfair labor practices by the company, including interrogation and threats, as grounds for the ruling.
*   The decision allows the National Labor Relations Board to order bargaining even when a union loses a representation vote due to employer misconduct.

The National Labor Relations Board will now oversee the process of P&B Transport entering into negotiations with the Teamsters.
