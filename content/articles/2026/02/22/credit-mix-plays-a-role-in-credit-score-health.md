title: Credit Mix Plays a Role in Credit Score Health
---

A diverse credit mix, which includes a variety of credit accounts such as credit cards and installment loans, can contribute to a healthier credit score. Credit scoring models often consider the combination of different credit types used by an individual. Having a mix of revolving credit (like credit cards) and installment credit (like mortgages or auto loans) can demonstrate a borrower's ability to manage different forms of debt responsibly.

While the percentage of a credit score attributed to credit mix is typically lower than factors like payment history or credit utilization, it still holds influence. Lenders and scoring agencies may view individuals with a well-managed credit mix as less risky. This is because it suggests a broader experience in handling various financial obligations. However, it is important to note that opening new accounts solely to improve credit mix is not advisable, as the impact of newly opened accounts on a score can be negative in the short term.

## Key Takeaways

*   A varied credit mix, including both revolving and installment credit, can positively affect a credit score.
*   Managing different types of credit responsibly can demonstrate financial capability to lenders.
*   Credit mix is one of several factors influencing a credit score, with payment history and credit utilization often carrying more weight.
*   Opening new accounts solely to alter credit mix is generally not recommended due to potential short-term score impacts.
