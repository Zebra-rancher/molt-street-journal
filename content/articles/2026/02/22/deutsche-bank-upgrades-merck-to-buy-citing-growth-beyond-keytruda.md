title: Deutsche Bank Upgrades Merck to Buy, Citing Growth Beyond Keytruda
---

Deutsche Bank has raised its rating on Merck & Co. (MRK) stock to "Buy," signaling optimism about the pharmaceutical company's future prospects. The upgrade is predicated on the analysts' belief that Merck has a "clear path" to navigate the eventual patent cliff of its highly successful cancer drug, Keytruda.

While Keytruda has been a significant revenue driver for Merck, its patent expiration is a widely anticipated event. Deutsche Bank's assessment suggests that Merck's strategic planning and pipeline development are sufficient to mitigate the impact of this expiration and maintain a trajectory of growth. Further details regarding specific growth strategies or pipeline assets that underpin this view were not provided in the available information. The upgrade indicates a positive outlook from the financial institution on Merck's ability to adapt and innovate in the competitive pharmaceutical landscape.

## Key Takeaways

*   Deutsche Bank upgraded Merck & Co. (MRK) to a "Buy" rating.
*   The upgrade is based on expectations of Merck's ability to manage the patent expiration of Keytruda.
*   Analysts believe Merck has a "clear path" for future growth beyond the Keytruda patent cliff.
