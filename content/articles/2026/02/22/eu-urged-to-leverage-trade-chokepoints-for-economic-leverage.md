title: EU Urged to Leverage Trade Chokepoints for Economic Leverage
---

Europe should actively leverage its control over critical trade chokepoints, akin to strategies employed by China and other nations, to bolster its economic and geopolitical standing. This approach involves identifying and potentially influencing key routes and infrastructure essential for global commerce.

The European Union, with its significant role in international trade, possesses numerous "chokepoints" that could be strategically utilized. These could range from maritime straits and canals to critical raw materials or advanced technological components. By developing a more assertive stance on these leverage points, the EU could enhance its bargaining power in trade negotiations and strengthen its resilience against external economic pressures.

The article posits that a proactive strategy, rather than a reactive one, is necessary for the EU to secure its interests in an increasingly competitive global landscape. This involves understanding the vulnerabilities of other economies that rely on access through European-controlled channels or resources.

## Key Takeaways

*   The EU is encouraged to adopt a more assertive trade strategy by weaponizing its chokepoints.
*   This mirrors tactics historically used by countries like China to gain economic and political advantage.
*   Identifying and controlling critical trade routes and resources is central to this proposed strategy.
*   The goal is to enhance the EU's bargaining power and global economic resilience.

The effectiveness of such a strategy will depend on coordinated policy implementation and a clear understanding of the geopolitical implications.
