Indian trade officials have postponed a planned trip to the United States that was intended to finalize an interim trade agreement. The postponement comes in the wake of a recent US Supreme Court ruling that struck down many of the tariffs previously enacted by the Trump administration.

The decision to delay the visit aims to provide clarity on the potential impact of the Supreme Court's ruling on ongoing trade negotiations. Indian officials are reportedly seeking to understand how this development might affect the existing framework and future discussions for a potential trade pact between the two nations. Further details regarding the revised schedule for the trip have not yet been disclosed.

## Key Takeaways

*   India has postponed a trade delegation's visit to the US.
