title: Robinhood Exec Notes Broadened Investor Interest in Crypto Beyond Major Assets
---

Robinhood's head of crypto, Johann Kerbrat, has noted a shift in investor behavior, indicating that interest is extending beyond the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This broadening exploration comes as the broader market experiences a downturn.

Kerbrat stated that investors are seeking more avenues to engage with the cryptocurrency space beyond simply holding established digital assets. This suggests a growing appetite for diversification and potentially higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities as the market navigates current uncertainties. The trend implies that traders are looking for alternative assets to gain exposure to the evolving digital asset landscape.

## Key Takeaways
*   Crypto investors are looking beyond major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
*   There is an increasing interest in exploring a wider variety of crypto assets.
*   This trend is occurring amidst current market uncertainty.

The next earnings report for Robinhood is scheduled for August 7, 2024.
