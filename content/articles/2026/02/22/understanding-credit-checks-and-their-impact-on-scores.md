title: Understanding Credit Checks and Their Impact on Scores
---

When evaluating your creditworthiness, it's important to understand the different types of credit checks and how they may influence your credit score. Credit inquiries are generally categorized into two main types: hard inquiries and soft inquiries.

A hard inquiry occurs when a lender checks your credit report as part of a credit application, such as for a mortgage, auto loan, or credit card. These inquiries indicate that you are actively seeking new credit. Because taking on new debt can be a risk to lenders, multiple hard inquiries within a short period can signal a higher risk, potentially leading to a slight decrease in your credit score. Lenders typically consider the impact of these inquiries over a period of one to two years.

In contrast, a soft inquiry, sometimes referred to as a "soft pull," happens when your credit is checked for reasons other than a direct application for new credit. Examples include checking your own credit score, pre-approved credit card offers, or background checks by potential employers. Soft inquiries do not impact your credit score and are not visible to lenders reviewing your credit report for lending decisions. Therefore, consumers can check their own credit reports and scores without concern for negative effects.

## Key Takeaways
*   Credit inquiries are divided into "hard" and "soft" types.
*   Hard inquiries result from applying for new credit and can affect your credit score.
*   Soft inquiries, used for pre-approvals or self-checks, do not impact credit scores.
*   Lenders primarily consider hard inquiries when assessing credit risk over a one- to two-year timeframe.
