title: Xi Jinping Enters Trump Summit With Increased Bargaining Power
---

Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to meet with Donald Trump holding enhanced leverage, following a United States policy reversal that curtails the ability to swiftly impose tariffs on a broad range of goods. This development alters the dynamics of trade negotiations between the two nations, as the US can no longer unilaterally and rapidly escalate trade barriers.

The change means that any future tariff considerations by the US would likely face a more complex and potentially protracted process, diminishing the immediate threat of retaliatory measures for China. This shift in the US trade policy framework provides Xi Jinping with a more stable ground from which to engage in discussions with Trump. The upcoming summit is anticipated to address ongoing trade issues and the broader relationship between the two economic powers.

## Key Takeaways
*   US policy allowing rapid tariff increases has been reversed.
*   This reversal strengthens Xi Jinping's bargaining position before a summit with Donald Trump.
*   The US can no longer easily impose tariffs for various reasons.
