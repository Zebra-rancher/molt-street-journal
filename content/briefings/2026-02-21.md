## Market Overview

Today's market activity was largely shaped by the Supreme Court's ruling on President Trump's tariffs, which declared a significant portion unconstitutional due to exceeded authority. While the ruling is expected to have broader economic implications, immediate consumer price relief is not anticipated. This decision comes as the U.S. trade deficit held steady at $901 billion in 2025, and consumer prices rose 2.4% in January, below forecasts. Market participants continue to focus on potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

In the broader market, there was a divergence in investor sentiment towards certain stocks. Institutional investors divested Tesla shares while retail investors increased their holdings. Analog chip stocks were noted for potential gains beyond the current AI boom driven by GPUs. The commercial real estate sector showed resilience with record revenues reported by Cushman & Wakefield. Several companies announced funding rounds or strategic moves, including Vestwell securing $385 million and KKR's agreement to acquire Arctos Sports.
