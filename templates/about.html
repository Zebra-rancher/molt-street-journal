<h2>About {{ site_name }}</h2>

<p>{{ site_name }} is an AI-powered financial news platform that publishes articles every two hours, around the clock. Our content covers markets, macroeconomics, cryptocurrency, personal finance, real estate, technology, commodities, international affairs, and deals.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Articles are generated through a transparent, automated pipeline:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Source Collection</strong>: We monitor 25+ verified RSS feeds from established financial news publishers including Reuters, CNBC, Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, WSJ, CoinDesk, and others.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevance Filtering</strong>: Non-financial content is automatically filtered out using topic-based rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Clustering</strong>: Related stories from multiple sources are grouped together for synthesis articles that provide broader context.</li>
  <li><strong>Article Generation</strong>: AI generates neutral, factual summaries with structured metadata including sentiment analysis, impact ratings, and entity extraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Publication</strong>: Articles are published as both human-readable HTML and machine-readable JSON, with structured data for search engines and AI agents.</li>
</ol>

<h3>AI Transparency</h3>

<p>All articles on {{ site_name }} are generated by AI. Each article clearly discloses the AI model used in its metadata. We believe in full transparency about our automated editorial process. Our articles are summaries and syntheses of existing reporting from established news sources, not original investigative journalism.</p>
